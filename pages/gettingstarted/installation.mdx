# Installation

## Slack Installation (and scopes)

To install Axolo, you‚Äôll need to sign up from [our home page](https://axolo.co). We will require access to specific scopes in order to be able to push notifications and create channels as a Slack application.

### Required Slack scopes:


| Scope    |  Reason  |
| :---     |          --- |
| app_mentions:read | View messages that directly mention @axolo in conversations |
| channels:manage | Manage public channels that Axolo has been added to and create new ones |
| chat:write | Post messages in approved channels & conversations |
| chat:write.public| Send messages to channels @axolo isn't a member of |
| im:history | View messages and other content in direct messages that Axolo has been added to |
| im:write | Start direct messages with people |
| users:read | View people in a workspace |
| users:read.email | View email addresses of people in a workspace |

## Github installation (and scopes)
When the Slack application is installed, you‚Äôll be redirected to our [app.axolo.co/home](https://app.axolo.co/home) in order to install the Github application. 

You‚Äôll choose between installing Axolo on all of your organization repositories or select only specific repositories.
