## Add a new repository to Axolo

If you selected specific repositories and want to add new ones, go to your [Axolo home](https://app.axolo.co/home) and then click on the “Update Axolo to your Github apps” button. Select “Configure” (upper right), select your organization and in “Repository access” select new repositories and save.
